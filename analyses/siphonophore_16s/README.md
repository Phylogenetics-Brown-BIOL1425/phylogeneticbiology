# Siphonophore 16s example

The purpose of this example is to introduce you to the tools of a basic
phylogenetic analysis. It draws on a subset of the data from this paper:

Dunn, CW, PR Pugh, and SHD Haddock (2005) Molecular phylogenetics of the 
Siphonophora (Cnidaria), with implications for the evolution of functional 
specialization. Systematic Biology 54:916-935.

## Implementing the analysis

### Getting the data

The first step is to get the data. They can be downloaded from:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=txid42759%5BOrganism%3Aexp%5D%2016S%20Dunn

Under the "Send to:" menu, select "File:", then "FASTA" for the format.

Rename the downloaded fasta file as siph16s-raw.fasta.

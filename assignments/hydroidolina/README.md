# Hydroidolina Phylogeny Assignment

In this assignment you will reanalyze the data from the following paper:

Cartwright, P., Evans, N. M., Dunn, C. W., Marques, A. C., Miglietta, M. P., 
Schuchert, P., & Collins, A. G. (2008). Phylogenetics of Hydroidolina 
(Hydrozoa: Cnidaria). Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the UK, 
88(08), 1663-1672. 
[doi:10.1017/S0025315408002257](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315408002257)

Take a look at the paper to familiarize yourself with the problem at hand, the 
approach taken, the data used, and the analyses that are presented.

Table 1 of the paper presents the [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) accession 
numbers for all the data included in the analyses. I have extracted the data 
from Table 1 and are presented here in three files:

    28s.txt
    18s.txt
    16s.txt
    
Use the 
[NCBI Batch Entrez interface](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez) 
to download a fasta file for the sequences listed in each of these three files. 
From the top of the interface, select the 'Nucleotide' Database and chose a file 
of accession numbers. Click retrieve, and then follow the link that is generated. 
This will take you to a page with the sequence summaries. Click 'Send to', 
choose 'File' as the destination, 'FASTA' as the format, and then click 
'Create File'.

Repeat this for each of the three gene files.

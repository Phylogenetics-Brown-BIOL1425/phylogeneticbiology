## Assignments

- Friday, March 1. Complete the assignment described in 
`assignments/hydroidolina` through 'Phylogenetic analyses of each gene'

- Wednesday, March 6. Group presentations. Groups can consist of 2-4 registered students. 
Presentations should be 20-30 minutes. By March 6 each group should form up, 
pick a paper, and schedule their presentation. Group presentations must be made 
on or before April 17. Scheduling will be organized so that there is no more 
than one group presentation per class. 

- Friday, April 5. Complete the assignment described in 
  `assignments/hydroidolina-combined`.

- Wednesday, May 1. The written component of the final project is due by the 
beginning of class. Presentations of final projects in class.


## Software to install on your own computer

You will use the following programs to work with phylogenies on your laptop. We 
will use computationally intensive programs, such as raxml and mrbayes, on the 
cluster.


### For all computers:

- [Mesquite](http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquite/mesquite.html). Mesquite will 
require that you also install Java. OS X will prompt you to install Java when 
you launch mesquite, if you don't already have java installed. You can install 
Java on Microsoft Windows from the [Java site](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)

- [R](http://www.r-project.org)

- [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)

- [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.ch)

- [Tracer](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/)


### For OS X (ie, Macs):

- [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)


### For Microsoft Windows:

- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org)

- [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

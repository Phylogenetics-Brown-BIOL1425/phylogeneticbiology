# Phylogenetic Biology

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and documentation for 
Casey Dunn's Phylogenetic Biology course (Biology 1425) at Brown University, as 
taught in the spring of 2013.

See the [syllabus](https://bitbucket.org/caseywdunn/phylogeneticbiology/src/master/syllabus/Phylogenetic_Biology_Syllabus.pdf) 
for additional information.

The two books for the class are:

Baum, D. and Smith, S. (2012). Tree Thinking. An Introduction to Phylogenetic 
Biology. [Roberts Publishers](http://www.roberts-publishers.com/tree-thinking-an-introduction-to-phylogenetic-biology.html). 
Required.

Haddock, S. H. D. and Dunn, C. W. (2010). Practical Computing for Biologists. 
[Sinauer Associates](http://practicalcomputing.org). Optional.

## Assignments

- Wednesday, March 6. Group presentations. Groups can consist of 2-4 registered students. 
Presentations should be 20-30 minutes. By March 6 each group should form up, 
pick a paper, and schedule their presentation. Group presentations must be made 
on or before April 16. Scheduling will be organized so that there is no more 
than one group presentation per class. 

- Wednesday, May 1. The written component of the final project is due by the 
beginning of class.

- Wednesday, May 8. Presentations of final projects in class.


## Software to install on your own computer

You will use the following programs to work with phylogenies on your laptop. We 
will use computationally intensive programs, such as raxml and mrbayes, on the 
cluster.


### For all computers:

- [Mesquite](http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquite/mesquite.html). Mesquite will 
require that you also install Java. OS X will prompt you to install Java when 
you launch mesquite, if you don't already have java installed. You can install 
Java on Microsoft Windows from the [Java site](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)

- [R](http://www.r-project.org)

- [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)

- [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.ch)


### For OS X (ie, Macs):

- [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)


### For Microsoft Windows:

- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org)

- [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

The Applied Phylogenetics Workshop in Bodega Bay. This is another summer course 
on phylogenetics, but with a bit more emphasis on using phylogenies to test 
evolutionary questions:

# Phylogenetic Biology

This repository contains the source code, datasets, and documentation for 
Casey Dunn's Phylogenetic Biology course (Biology 1425) at Brown University.


## Software to install on your laptop

You will use the following programs to work with phylogenies on your laptop. We will use computationally intensive programs, such as raxml and mrbayes, on the cluster.

### For all computers:

- [Mesquite](http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquite/mesquite.html). Mesquite will require that you also install Java. OS X will prompt you to install Java when you launch mesquite, if you don't already have java installed. Follow this ling to install java on windows: http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp

- [R](http://www.r-project.org)

- [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)

- [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.ch)

 

### For OS X (ie, Macs):

- [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)

 

### For Microsoft Windows:

- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org)

- [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

The following sites have a wide variety of material that is relevant to the 
theory and and practice of phylogenetic biology.

An extensive list of tools, tutorials, and examples of phylogenetic tools in 
the programming language R:

The Workshop on Molecular Evolution at Woods Hole. This is an intensive summer 
course on phylogenetics, with an emphasis on building phylogenetic trees. Check 
out the faculty pages for lecture pdfs:

The Applied Phylogenetics Workshop in Bodega Bay. This is another summer course 
on phylogenetics, but with a bit more emphasis on using phylogenies to test 
evolutionary questions:

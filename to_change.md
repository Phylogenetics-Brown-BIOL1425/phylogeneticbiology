# Changes/ comments from students 2013

- More on discrete character evolution (model testing, reconstruction, 
  analyses of relationships between multiple characters).

- More R labs on character evolution.

- Labs were too fast, more time to follow along and apply what we cover.

- Maybe switch the labs and lectures, so that the lectures are in the short 
  period and the labs in the long period? This would require breaking up some 
  of the lecture.

- More assignments. Some could be partially completed analyses, where there are 
  missing steps in the middle that students need to complete. Definitely do 
  some R assignments. Could work together on assignments during lab.

- Add command and program names into the lectures, where relevant.
